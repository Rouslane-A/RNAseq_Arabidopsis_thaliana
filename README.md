Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs your improved **Markdown project README** with a clean structure and a new **‚ÄúNext Steps / To-Do‚Äù** section featuring multiple ideas for extending your RNA-seq project. I‚Äôve grouped the ideas into *Core Tasks*, *Visualization & Dashboard*, and *Advanced Options* so you can pick what fits your goals best.

# üß¨ RNAseq Analysis of *Arabidopsis thaliana*

This project involves building a complete **RNA-Seq analysis pipeline** using the genome of *Arabidopsis thaliana*.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

### **00_RawData**

Contains scripts for downloading the raw sequencing data.

### **00_RefData**

Includes the reference genome and annotation data used for alignment and downstream analyses.

### **01_AnalysisStepOne ‚Äî Quality Control**

Scripts and results for the **quality control** step can be found here.
Tools like *FastQC* and *MultiQC* were likely used to assess read quality.

### **02_AnalysisStepTwo ‚Äî Alignment**

Contains scripts and results for the **alignment step** using **HISAT2** to map reads to the reference genome.

### **03_AnalysisStepThree ‚Äî Feature Counting**

Includes scripts and output for **feature counting**, where read counts per gene are obtained (e.g., using *featureCounts*).

### **04_AnalysisStepFour ‚Äî Differential Expression Analysis**

Contains R scripts and results for **differential expression analysis** performed with the **DESeq2** package.

## ‚úÖ To-Do List & Future Improvements

### üß© Core Pipeline Enhancements

* [ ] **Create a Snakemake or Nextflow workflow**
  Automate the entire pipeline for reproducibility and scalability.

  * Option 1: Use **Nextflow** with a `main.nf` script and `nextflow.config`.
  * Option 2: Use **Snakemake** for lightweight dependency tracking.
  * Add **containerization** with Docker or Singularity for full reproducibility.

* [ ] **Add a Configuration File (YAML/JSON)**
  Store paths, parameters, and references in a single config file.

* [ ] **Integrate Logging & Metadata Tracking**
  Keep track of sample metadata, QC summaries, and software versions automatically.

---

### üìä Visualization & Dashboard

* [ ] **Build a Results Dashboard**
  Options:

  * **R Shiny app** for interactive QC and DE results visualization.
  * **Python Dash/Plotly dashboard** for web-based exploration.
  * **Streamlit dashboard** for a quick, lightweight option.

* [ ] **Integrate Visualization Tools**

  * Volcano and MA plots for differential expression.
  * Heatmaps for top DE genes.
  * PCA plots for sample clustering.
  * Gene ontology (GO) enrichment charts.

* [ ] **Create a MultiQC Summary Report**
  Automatically aggregate QC metrics and alignment stats across samples.

### üöÄ Advanced Options

* [ ] **Add Workflow Management on HPC or Cloud**

  * Support for running the pipeline on **SLURM**, **AWS Batch**, or **Google Cloud**.
  * Use **Nextflow Tower** or **Snakemake Executor** for monitoring.

* [ ] **Containerize the Pipeline**

  * Create a **Dockerfile** or **Singularity recipe** with all dependencies.
  * Register the container on **Docker Hub** or **Quay.io**.

* [ ] **Automated Report Generation**

  * Use **R Markdown** or **Jupyter Notebooks** to produce a publication-ready report.

* [ ] **Add Functional Annotation**

  * Integrate GO and KEGG enrichment analysis for DE genes.

* [ ] **Implement Version Control for Data**

  * Use **DVC (Data Version Control)** to track large files and results efficiently.

## üß† Summary

This pipeline automates the full RNA-Seq workflow ‚Äî from raw data download to differential expression analysis ‚Äî and provides a strong foundation for building scalable, reproducible, and visually engaging bioinformatics tools for *A. thaliana*.


I can adapt the next version accordingly.
